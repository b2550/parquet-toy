# Parquet

Parquet is a math art project that creates and animates [Parquet Deformations](http://www.tess-elation.co.uk/parquet-deformations). It creates very pretty patterns. It is essentially a library for [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Library

Parquet has a library that can be used with Processing! See `examples` to get an idea of how to use it.

As of this moment, the library does not have documentaiton. However inside the `src` file you will find the source code if you want to figure it out yourself.

## How to use example

1. Use the drawing window to create a drawing. This can be done by **clicking and dragging** to create a new line. While drawing a line, **right click** to cancel. If not drawing a line, **right click** to undo. Hold **shift** to snap new lines to 45° angles.
2. Press **Set Frame 1** 
3. Move the lines of your drawing around using the blue handles.
4. Press **Set Frame 2**
5. Press the **spacebar** to close the drawing panel and enjoy the animation you created


Press **backspace** to reset workspace and frames so you can make a new drawing
Click the **Interpolation Mode** button to cycle though different ways of interpolating the deformation

# Parquet

Parquet is a math art project that creates and animates [Parquet Deformations](http://www.tess-elation.co.uk/parquet-deformations). It creates very pretty patterns. It is essentially a library for [Processing](https://processing.org/).

## Library

Parquet has a library that can be used with Processing! See `examples` to get an idea of how to use it.

As of this moment, the library does not have documentaiton. However inside the `src` file you will find the source code if you want to figure it out yourself.
